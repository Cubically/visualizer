# Cubically's Visualizer

A Rubik's Cube emulator for the command line. It uses `rubiks.c` from Cubically and `stdin.c` from ASCIIgame.

Cubically was initially built for this visualizer; this was Cubically before it became an esoteric programming language.

 - To build it, run `make` (assumes you have Make and GCC installed). This will generate the executable `visualizer`.
 - To run it, run `./visualizer`, appending a cube size as a command-line argument optionally. This clears the screen and launches the emulator.
